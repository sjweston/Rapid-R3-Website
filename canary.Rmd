These analyses are based on responses collected from `r papaja::printnum(n_care, format = "d")` caregivers between the dates of `r date.min` and `r date.max`. These caregivers represent a range of voices: `r papaja::printnum(perc.black)`\% are Black/African American, `r papaja::printnum(perc.latinx)`\% are LatinX, and `r papaja::printnum(perc.fpl[2])`\% live at or below 1.5 times the federal poverty line. Proportions/percentages are calculated based on the item-level response rates, not out of the total sample size. The data for these analyses are *not* weighted.

# Total Conflict

Families have many different ways of trying to settle their differences. This is a list of things that might happen when your family has differences. Please mark how many times each of these things happened in the last week. Please also think about a typical week in your family’s like prior to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and mark how many times each of these things happened. If one of these things did not occur, then select “This has not happened" for that question.

- I shouted, yelled, or screamed at my child 
- I criticized or said mean things to my child 
- I felt like throwing things or slamming doors 
- My partner insulted or swore or shouted or yelled at me

# Cohesiveness

When you and your child have spent time together, how often did you do the following? 

- I let my child know I really care about them 
- I was loving and affectionate toward my child 
- I was supportive and understanding toward my child 
- I told my child I love them
