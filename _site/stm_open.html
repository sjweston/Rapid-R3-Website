##      Our biggest concerns is still catching covid 19 from just being out and doing essential things, there are many people not wearing mask around our area. We also do not know who has it because like health officials have mentioned, somebody can be positive and not feel any symptoms, even when we want to sneeze and cough, we force not to because we don&#39;t want anybody discriminating about us too.
##      Our child is so ridiculously fussy and we feel so helpless as she just screams and whines all the time now and nobody believes us.  We are strongly opposed to cry it out so we feel like we&#39;re traumatizing her because she cries all the time even with us holding her constantly.  We have no idea what&#39;s wrong with her and everyone tells us that she&#39;s normal and babies whine.  This is beyond that and we don&#39;t have anyone to help us because we are scared to have people come over.
##      When to venture out again, most people don&#39;t seem to be taking precautions so I don&#39;t want to expose my family.</code></pre>

##       Well, we just found out Saturday that or landlord has notified the homeowners across the street that they will be tearing down our building to build a 300-unit apartment complex here instead. There was no date on the postcard saying when construction would begin, but we can&#39;t afford anywhere else it looks like and the idea of moving with a newborn is daunting.
##      My marriage is really strained. It wasn&#39;t great to begin with, but this has made it so much worse.
##      Newish (3years) marriage with twin toddlers living in a tiny apartment. Alot of change really fast and a tiny living space.
##      Helping my child move forward with his IEP goals, especially the social/emotional and speech.

## Coping with our child finally going through the “no” phase. It’s developmentally important but making things really hard on us right now.

## We’re on edge. I totally panicked last night when I noticed a vehicle creeping up slowly, shining a flashlight on the laundromat across the street and into the dark and bushy areas surrounding it. It took several minutes, but eventually it pulled away and I saw it was a Sheriff’s vehicle. A few days back I heard lots of honking and wondered if it was rioters. It turned out being a graduation celebration, but took about 10 minutes for me to figure that out and it was alarming. That’s twice this week I’ve found myself trying to peek out my window without being in front of my window because I didn’t know if it was safe.
##      Our housing problem started before covid but it definitely boiled into a whole bigger issue once this virus hit and even though I have extensive proof of everything that happened, no one, not the city I live in, not the court system in our city, council members in this area, I mean no one seems to care of this slumlord violates every right a tenant is supposed to have. I had eviction court last week and I wasn&#39;t even allowed in because i &quot;had a fever of 102&quot; yet i got home and took my temp three times on 2 different thermometers and I was under 98.6. So I literally wasn&#39;t allowed to defend myself, they refused to take or even look at any of our evidence, and they told us we had 30 days and were going to have another court date and then a magistrate made a ruling for my slumlord the next morning. I cannot even find a new place willing to work with us because people assume eviction makes me the trash in this situation but the truth is I almost lost my life in this property and my children have been hurt and even almost seriously hurt as well but this city doesn&#39;t seem to care. Not knowing if you&#39;ll be homeless while covid is still going around us literally terrifying and I can&#39;t believe we got our lives together and came so far to get totally screwed by some garbage person who values a meager amount of money over a family of 4 and their lives and mental and emotional health and I really can&#39;t believe no one seems to care either way.</code></pre>

##       We just started a nannyshare with a neighbor/colleague for our 4.5 year old, 6 month old, and our neighbor&#39;s 7 month old. Our 6 month old cries the entire day. The ENTIRE DAY. Every moment she&#39;s awake she scream cries. She cries so much her voice is hoarse. She gave herself a blood nose yesterday. So our 4.5 year old is reasonably distressed and just hangs out in the basement or hides in our home &quot;office&quot; with his earphones on. I recognize that this may be partly developmental, but it&#39;s painful. The only silver lining (small, and mixed bag) is that she sleeps well for the nanny, but this is partly because she&#39;s so exhausted from crying that she just passes out.

However, I think they are going to end up not watching her at all because the college I am going to work to plans to re-open face to face.  I don&#39;t blame them.  Every interaction we have with other people in-person amplifies our risks for contracting COVID-19 exponentially.
##      Preparing to have a baby in the next week during the pandemic.
##      having to wait for testing when there are signs showing something is wrong with your child. What took maybe 2 weeks to get tested is now taking months.
##      Preparing for a second baby (just found out we&#39;re expecting)
##      I am trying to work from home as a 1099 independent contractor doing telepractice speech therapy.  I am working 7 days per week to see half my caseload, and half of the sessions that do occur are rescheduled 2 or 3 times.  This is very distressful to my daughter, who turns 3 this week. My husband is still working outside the home.  On Saturday, I gave in and asked my mother-in-law to help with childcare for 3 days a week, despite our county in our state still being under a stay-at-home order.  I needed to preserve my and my daughter&#39;s mental health.  Unfortunately, this is somewhat risky because my husband works in healthcare.</code></pre>

##  Topic 22: 
##       My son is speech delayed (20 months old and has no verbal words) and his pediatrician would not see him for his 18 month appointment and would not refer him to speech therapy. We referred him ourselves as parents and he now receives early intervention services but that is all. He has no socializing and his speech therapy is all via Zoom.
##      My main challenge is getting my 2 year old the care that he needs. He has multiple medical/developmental issues. Offices have been closed, surgeries cancelled, therapy has gone virtual. I can&#39;t bring my daughter with me to his appointments so my husband has missed work. I broke a bone in my foot and couldn&#39;t go to the ER because I couldn&#39;t bring the kids. My children&#39;s peds office was closed for months so my newborn daughter didn&#39;t have an appointment until she was 2 months old. Getting medical care, therapy, etc. for myself and my kids has been a compete DISASTER.
##      Balance.  We&#39;re both professors and are not being paid,  but he&#39;s on COVID committees for his university. This means he&#39;s working all the time,  while I care for the kids. This means I&#39;m barely working, which puts me at risk.  I feel like he&#39;s thriving work wise, and I&#39;m drowning.
##      Social interactions for our child (or lack thereof), our child may also have some speech delay and we have reached out to our state program for speech therapy and are awaiting our evaluation results but even if we are eligible I wonder about the effectiveness of online speech therapy.
##      My husband is furloughed effective October 1st and he was just notified that he was a close contact of someone who tested positive for COVID; my husband has no symptoms and is awaiting test results.</code></pre>

##  Topic 27: 
##       At the 10 day of school count our elementary school had so many children they needed to hire 5 teachers, so instead of allowing us to switch our method of schooling after first quarter in Oct. we were given until this past Friday to decide. It’s either now, 3 weeks into school or January, so in what seems like a year of never ending difficult decisions, we had yet another. We opted to keep our 5 and 9 year old home and have hopefully some sense of consistency until then at least. We are hoping that their teachers remain the same until then and there are no more surprises for awhile. We miss normalcy and friends, but I am doing my best to keep my kids safe and educated.
##      In February I was to start utilizing a local workforce education and certification program in order to start working at a daycare facility part time. There has been a daycare provider shortage in my area for over a year and this was the only way I could get my child into a daycare because they allow staff members’ age appropriate children to attend as a benefit. Both options were closed down and are still closed. I am not even allowed to access study materials and test online for the childcare certifications needed. My family is surviving this pandemic but we’ve had to be extremely careful financially. I am worried once the daycares open up there will be so many others needing/wanting the same positions at this specific daycare that I will lose the opportunity to even have a chance at the position because I am unable to access the free certification program.
##      School. On the social/emotional level our child needs (and wants) to go, but on a health and safety standpoint he can’t handle it. He gravitates toward danger and loooooves putting things in his mouth.
## 
## Also, my hubby’s job isn’t what we would classify as stable. Restaurants it’s a little shaky on how they can remain open and we won’t be surprised if it needs to close up again with the way this pandemic is going.
##      I want my kids back in school. They need to be taught by their teachers. They need to see their peers. I need a break from them. They need a break from each other.
##      Having to work full time and be a full time mom doesn&#39;t allow me to be great at either. We need to go back to normal.</code></pre>

##       I have had many health issues, due to stress. My body handles stress very poorly, and not without many venues to relax and wind down. I built up too much stress in my body that it caused me multiple visits to the doctor. therefore, way too many hospital bills...
##      Re-entering into society after isolation. We are still being cautious which is difficult when some family are not doing the same.
##      Our biggest challenges relate to childcare for my daughter. Prior to COVID-19, my mother-in-law, grandparents, and a mother-figure (woman who was my father&#39;s girlfriend for 20 years, including the majority of my childhood) of mine watched my daughter while I worked outside the home. I am currently doing tele practice speech therapy. As Berks County prepares to enter the green phase of re-opening in Pennsylvania, I may be expected to go back to providing home-based services and need increased childcare.  However, all caregivers except my mother-in-law are elderly and immune compromised.  I can&#39;t comfortably ask them to come back, but my mother-in-law is a self-employed photographer and needs to work too.
##      Constant change and adjustments to our schedule due to my husband&#39;s varying schedule to work physically.
##      The biggest challenge for us now is that sometimes we need to avoid many people outside when going out, so as to not have much contact with people. That means that we have to choose inconvenient times for us. Compared to the obstacles that we have overcome, this really is not that much of a big deal.</code></pre>

##       Our housing problem started before covid but it definitely boiled into a whole bigger issue once this virus hit and even though I have extensive proof of everything that happened, no one, not the city I live in, not the court system in our city, council members in this area, I mean no one seems to care of this slumlord violates every right a tenant is supposed to have. I had eviction court last week and I wasn&#39;t even allowed in because i &quot;had a fever of 102&quot; yet i got home and took my temp three times on 2 different thermometers and I was under 98.6. So I literally wasn&#39;t allowed to defend myself, they refused to take or even look at any of our evidence, and they told us we had 30 days and were going to have another court date and then a magistrate made a ruling for my slumlord the next morning. I cannot even find a new place willing to work with us because people assume eviction makes me the trash in this situation but the truth is I almost lost my life in this property and my children have been hurt and even almost seriously hurt as well but this city doesn&#39;t seem to care. Not knowing if you&#39;ll be homeless while covid is still going around us literally terrifying and I can&#39;t believe we got our lives together and came so far to get totally screwed by some garbage person who values a meager amount of money over a family of 4 and their lives and mental and emotional health and I really can&#39;t believe no one seems to care either way.

##      Finding a safe and affordable location away from looting, rioting, fireworks, gunshots, protests,  homelessness epidemic, failed schools, overpriced housing and failed public institutions/government.  All of these negative trends have been significantly accelerated by the Covid crisis.  Urban centers are now VERY dangerous and VERY unhealthy places for people especially people with kids.  It is very clear that our child has been traumatized by a combination of being forced inside by the pandemic while watching protesters and rioters from the window.  He has a sound sensitivity and the gunshots and fireworks are pretty constant after dark.

## Where to go though is the million $ question.  I have lived in the DC city core for 20+ years so it is very daunting to have to plan to evacuate your home you have loved for such a long time especially during a pandemic.

##       Sleep. The kids aren&#39;t sleeping good, which ensures we don&#39;t sleep good either.
##      Our child is so ridiculously fussy and we feel so helpless as she just screams and whines all the time now and nobody believes us.  We are strongly opposed to cry it out so we feel like we&#39;re traumatizing her because she cries all the time even with us holding her constantly.  We have no idea what&#39;s wrong with her and everyone tells us that she&#39;s normal and babies whine.  This is beyond that and we don&#39;t have anyone to help us because we are scared to have people come over.
##      We just started a nannyshare with a neighbor/colleague for our 4.5 year old, 6 month old, and our neighbor&#39;s 7 month old. Our 6 month old cries the entire day. The ENTIRE DAY. Every moment she&#39;s awake she scream cries. She cries so much her voice is hoarse. She gave herself a blood nose yesterday. So our 4.5 year old is reasonably distressed and just hangs out in the basement or hides in our home &quot;office&quot; with his earphones on. I recognize that this may be partly developmental, but it&#39;s painful. The only silver lining (small, and mixed bag) is that she sleeps well for the nanny, but this is partly because she&#39;s so exhausted from crying that she just passes out.
##      4-month-old does not sleep well and takes up a lot of our time, so we don&#39;t have time for simple household chores.

I typically made 1800-1900 per week before setting aside for taxes prior to the pandemic.  To qualify for PUA, I have to make less than 717$ per week.  I currently average 700-800$ per week due to cancellations and no-shows.

##       I went back to work for 2 weeks in March before my school closed where I am an childhood educator working part time. I went from working 40 hrs a week to 28 hrs a week after returning from maternity leave. Then the pandemic closed my school. So, my director has paid us our usual salary since March, but we are now being furloughed for July and possibly further. I will need to file for unemployment. So I have gone from fulltime to part time to no employment after maternity leave. That is a lot of change for my family’s finances. We are trying to keep up without draining savings.
##      I am taking a leave of absence from my job in a public elementary school because we are not allowed to do online only as employees and we have had a large spike in cases since university students have returned to town.
##      I have been furloughed where I work at a school 28 hours a week. I was paid by my employer up until July and will now have to file for unemployment indefinitely. My employer is thinking of opening the school in August with minimal teachers and fewer classrooms so I do not know when I will return to work. I am going to make only 60% of my usual pay on unemployment and that’s stressful.
##      I don’t think my husband and I are very good at “preschool” activities for the kids and we don’t know how to beat engage their creative side.
##      I worked as a nurse and had my baby 1/20/2020 and was on maternity leave when covid hit. I quit my job due to lack of childcare because my employer would not allow me to work part time night shift so that I could arrange childcare. I felt uncomfortable leaving them in daycare. So we have taken a large pay cut and I have looked for a new job that can accommodate my weekend night shift schedule so that my husband can watch the kids while they sleep.</code></pre>

##       Distancing from others. There are more and more individuals outside with their other children, without protection on such as masks. We&#39;re trying to keep our distance while keeping our children active so they have a balance. We are also moving to another location in the state partially because of timing, but also because where we are going has fewer confirmed cases on a daily basis. But also because our children need more space where we are not hampered by others right on top of us in a community. Also, close contact with movers, realtors, and other things that we have to handle to still survive. We&#39;re taking the maximum precautions. But our children are tired just like us. They make comments such as &quot;we can&#39;t do that because of the virus&quot;. I hear other children in my 8 year olds virtual morning meeting saying &quot;we had to be real careful because of the coronavirus&quot;, or &quot;we heard a friend died from the coronavirus&quot;. Our children are both aware of the risk.

##      We have no idea what to do for school and childcare. There’s no right answer. We are scared to go back to work to teach as well.  We’ll  be at 4 different schools with so much varied exposure.  Even though we’ve practiced with masks our children are not consistent.  I’m also worried about how I can work and keep kids home.  I also worry that this os not “beat” for them
##      Right now it is difficult to engage in social learning and to provide educational needs of all my children as well as basic needs due to our income restrictions and social distancing because of covid 19. Also the stress of making our bill payments can be a bit overwhelming at times. We are thankful we can make these payments and provide a home for our family.

##       Our housing problem started before covid but it definitely boiled into a whole bigger issue once this virus hit and even though I have extensive proof of everything that happened, no one, not the city I live in, not the court system in our city, council members in this area, I mean no one seems to care of this slumlord violates every right a tenant is supposed to have. I had eviction court last week and I wasn&#39;t even allowed in because i &quot;had a fever of 102&quot; yet i got home and took my temp three times on 2 different thermometers and I was under 98.6. So I literally wasn&#39;t allowed to defend myself, they refused to take or even look at any of our evidence, and they told us we had 30 days and were going to have another court date and then a magistrate made a ruling for my slumlord the next morning. I cannot even find a new place willing to work with us because people assume eviction makes me the trash in this situation but the truth is I almost lost my life in this property and my children have been hurt and even almost seriously hurt as well but this city doesn&#39;t seem to care. Not knowing if you&#39;ll be homeless while covid is still going around us literally terrifying and I can&#39;t believe we got our lives together and came so far to get totally screwed by some garbage person who values a meager amount of money over a family of 4 and their lives and mental and emotional health and I really can&#39;t believe no one seems to care either way.
##      My marriage is really strained. It wasn&#39;t great to begin with, but this has made it so much worse.
##      We had been looking forward to our vacation. We had been offered by friends (whom we work with and share a bubble with) to join them at a house on the beach in Outerbanks with their family. We had been monitoring the situation of COVID cases as they rise for the past several weeks with alarm. This was to be a very special and rare vacation for us and we’ve been watching it slip away. It had been a bright spot for us to look forward too. We even asked our family doctor what his professional opinion was and he concluded that as long as we were smart we would probably be fine. And even though the county we would be visiting has had a total of only 16 cases this entire time, we were put into an ultimatum. Two weeks before we were to leave, NYS put together a list of states that residents were banned from traveling to unless they quarantined. Added to that if we were to get sick afterward we could be fined up to $10,000 and no paid sick time. This was confirmed my our employer (my husband and I work for the same place) we could take our week vacation but would need to take the two week Mandatory quarantine without pay. That would mean we would lose two paychecks just for a week of leisure. The remote possibility that we could jeopardize the financial safety of our family through fines and no paychecks, petrified us. We chose to back out. Two of the most stressful and hard parts of this process have been the complexity of feelings that come from being forced into a situation. We were taking so many precautions to do this correctly, but that didn’t matter, the state had layed out their blanket rules. I never knew I would have to make a decision this heavy over a vacation! The second hardest part is dealing with the social repercussions, which not aLot of people talk about now. We didn’t know how this would affect our friendship. They are still trying to figure out a way to go... they have the right to make their own decisions, but we didn’t know if they would resen

##  Topic 6: 
##       We just started a nannyshare with a neighbor/colleague for our 4.5 year old, 6 month old, and our neighbor&#39;s 7 month old. Our 6 month old cries the entire day. The ENTIRE DAY. Every moment she&#39;s awake she scream cries. She cries so much her voice is hoarse. She gave herself a blood nose yesterday. So our 4.5 year old is reasonably distressed and just hangs out in the basement or hides in our home &quot;office&quot; with his earphones on. I recognize that this may be partly developmental, but it&#39;s painful. The only silver lining (small, and mixed bag) is that she sleeps well for the nanny, but this is partly because she&#39;s so exhausted from crying that she just passes out.
##      Our child is so ridiculously fussy and we feel so helpless as she just screams and whines all the time now and nobody believes us.  We are strongly opposed to cry it out so we feel like we&#39;re traumatizing her because she cries all the time even with us holding her constantly.  We have no idea what&#39;s wrong with her and everyone tells us that she&#39;s normal and babies whine.  This is beyond that and we don&#39;t have anyone to help us because we are scared to have people come over.
##      4-month-old does not sleep well and takes up a lot of our time, so we don&#39;t have time for simple household chores.
##      My mother in law is in the hospital for a GI bleed and my grandpa is in hospice.
##      My 14-month-old daughter is having a really difficult time sleeping the past two weeks or so. It is probably that she is teething and getting in about 6-8 teeth, but it is really impacting everyone in the household&#39;s sleep and sanity.

##       Mental health/behavior of my elementary age child and how that is impacting the entire family - more anxious, acting out, rude, defiant. This is causing younger siblings to act out in the same and causing parents to be overwhelmed, stressed and more likely to yell and feel out of control of the household.
##      This feels never ending. There&#39;s no morale. What do I tell my kids about the world they are going to grow up in? That they have no rights, that no one sees them as anything more than a germ to avoid? I hate that society has de-humanized each other. I am afraid for their futures.

##       #1. Enrollment to PreK for the next year. We are contractually committed to a program however we do not want to ensure the learning disruption that occurred this year again, should there be a second wave. #2 remote learning does not provide the value that we pay in the negotiated cost of private preK tuition #3 a large part of the value is the socialization component which may be reduced or eliminated if classes are modified or remote learning is deemed the only safe alternative. #4 home schooling- taking on a larger educator role at home and balancing the new dynamic that entails.
##      Being successful at distance learning with a preschool, kindergartener and 1st grader. Finishing my Masters degree in Special Ed.
##      Navigating on-line learning and ensuring he is getting an appropriate education.
##      Navigating homeschooling; my children aren’t a private school with a remote learning option, and we are the only family in their classes that has opted for remote learning. We purchased a secular homeschool curriculum (because 5 &amp; 3 year olds don’t want to sit in front of an iPad), and check in with their classes a few times a week. We are learning what schooling looks like for us.
##      Ensuring quality education/ learning experience within hybrid schedule.</code></pre>

##       We’ve been keeping to our strategy for not over eating or over using resources. But we are becoming concerned as we have been utilizing resources and many resources are losing funding. So it is scary and worrisome for me because there are only so many ways we can problem solve to stay afloat. Even in a tight community like ours, eventually people will need to stop helping others to sustain themselves.
##      My husband’s work decided to do an insurance audit on every employee in the middle of a pandemic. We almost lost our insurance because I couldn’t get documents I needed due to COVID closures. I need to get my little one into the doctor for her vision and hearing screening for school and no one will see her. My husband was in the hospital and could have died in March and he has been unable to see a doctor because no doctors in our area are accepting new patients.

##  Topic 31: 
##       Our biggest challenge is childcare and maintaining and income.  I am transitioning from a purely clinical position where I am currently able to telework due to the pandemic, to a faculty position where I am expected to be on campus and put my family at risk.  The Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) for independent contractors I have qualified for 3 weeks since the pandemic began, but my income has decreased greatly.  I typically made 1800-1900 per week before setting aside for taxes prior to the pandemic.  To qualify for PUA, I have to make less than 717$ per week.  I currently average 700-800$ per week due to cancellations and no-shows.

## My grandparents watch my daughter one day per week.  I would like them to watch my daughter 2 days per week so that I can get my work done.  However, I think they are going to end up not watching her at all because the college I am going to work to plans to re-open face to face.  I don&#39;t blame them.  Every interaction we have with other people in-person amplifies our risks for contracting COVID-19 exponentially.
##      I am trying to work from home as a 1099 independent contractor doing telepractice speech therapy.  I am working 7 days per week to see half my caseload, and half of the sessions that do occur are rescheduled 2 or 3 times.  This is very distressful to my daughter, who turns 3 this week. My husband is still working outside the home.  On Saturday, I gave in and asked my mother-in-law to help with childcare for 3 days a week, despite our county in our state still being under a stay-at-home order.  I needed to preserve my and my daughter&#39;s mental health.  Unfortunately, this is somewhat risky because my husband works in healthcare.
##      Childcare. I’m scheduled to start a new job next month, a faculty position. I only have a babysitter 3 days per week. My mother-in-law isn’t available 5 days per week. The college plans to open in-person and my department has said it’s “all hands on deck” due to smaller class sizes and needed to give students personalized attention. I’m going to need to be on campus a lot. I’m hoping my grandparents will watch my daughter two days per week, as they did pre-covid, but at the same time it feels super risky due to their age and health histories and me being around groups of people
## On campus.

##      I just need a break. When I chose marriage and kids over my career, I did so without the idea of living in isolation. Not being able to physically see and connect with my peers has a huge impact on my mental health, which in turn negatively affects my ability to balance parenting, educating, housekeeping and all of the other domestic shit that feels thankless and endless. I&#39;ve watched the business that I&#39;ve worked so hard for disintegrate overnight. It&#39;s tough to cope with the fact that my life&#39;s investment in myself feels like a waste right now because I&#39;m stuck in a 1950&#39;s life that I&#39;d be just as capable of living without 11 years of college education and tens of thousands of dollars spent on a business that was supposed to be my balance to ask if the domestic shit I committed to. Now I&#39;m just a fucking housewife.
##      I am worried about the coronavirus wiping out the stock market in the future.
##      I believe I have been laid off from my job even though my employer never formally laid me off. I have also been consuming alcohol on almost a regular basis since the pandemic began in order to deal with daily life. This has affected me and my family negatively in many ways. I am trying to limit my alcohol intake but I believe I may have become dependent on alcohol and I’m really struggling with this issue. I am also worried about the pandemic relief benefits expiring at the end of this month. I rely on that income to help pay bills and pay for food for my family. I am also concerned about the safety of my elderly parents during the pandemic. If they were to become infected with COVID-19 I’m scared they won’t make it through. They both have medical issues.

##      The fact that my husband has remained steadily employed and that I was already a stay at home mom so we aren’t scrambling for childcare. It’s nerve racking for my husband to leave each day and potentially be exposed but having a steady paycheck is a godsend.
##      My husband is an essential employee at our local hospital so he has been able to continue working this whole time. Thankfully otherwise we would be more dire in terms.of pay. I have been off work for a couple months and struggled to get unemployment. And then I was also expecting a baby so my status at work was changed from unemplpyment to maternity leave. So I lost the unemployment because now I am technically on FMLA leave and that has been hard in terms of our finances.

##      My mother-in-law is watching my daughter while I work 3 days per week and my grandparents are watching her one day per week. My husband tries to watch her Saturdays so I can work, but she definitely has a preference for her Mommy right now, which means I don&#39;t get much work done.  The clinical position being an independent contractor position is helpful because I have control over when I do my work.  Unfortunately, this the college I am going to work for walked back their previous statements about flexibility for faculty during the pandemic and made it clear that they play to return to&quot;business as usual&quot; for us, while being flexible for the students (which actually increases the typically faculty workload). However, the college should be a stable source of income and benefits compared with independent contracting.   Whereas I am normally a glass is half full, everything has silver linings kind of person, right now I don&#39;t trust anyone or any entity (college, government, etc.
##      Though it&#39;s truly anxiety-making in terms of exposure, sending my kids to preschool/daycare and returning to work has made a world of difference for the family.

##      P ebt for the children that was getting free lunches but cant now since they closed schools. Also the stimulus check helped a little but by the time we got it we where already 4 months behind on certain things and like now 2400 for me and my husband and we only get to file 3 or our kids at 500 a piece thats 3900. It sounds like a lot but, concidering that our rent is 650 a month, our power ranges from 500 to 650 a month, our 50$ water bill, internet for homescholling is close to 100$ a month, gas in two vehicles, then enough food for 6 children and two adults is an outragous amount by itself, and one more thing that i can think of off the top of my head is household products that we really need, but are now almost non existant in our household. With all of that and a lot more that i didnt put down like insurance both health and 2 vehicles that one time of a total of 3900$ is nowhere near what we need if its just going to be a single payment but a reacurring payment of like 1200 per person a month just for like 6 months to a year or so, would help us make it to a place where we would not have to worry even if the virus spikes back up i really want to get into owning real estate i have studied and watched the pros and im very comfortable with making this happen only thing thats in my way is the first down payment

##      We adore our son. His light and joy. Also we are seeking marriage counseling and independent counseling.
##      I am taking things day and day and minimizing my news intake.  Going to the gym to workout has helped to lift my mood and talking with my parents - and seeing them in person - has been a morale booster</code></pre>

##       Food haha.  It might sound pathetic, but I eat chocolate and ice cream and my husband likes soda and that gets us through the constant whining from our daughter.  Luckily neither of us has a weight problem.  We&#39;ll see if our blood sugar and teeth make it through this pandemic.
##      P ebt for the children that was getting free lunches but cant now since they closed schools. Also the stimulus check helped a little but by the time we got it we where already 4 months behind on certain things and like now 2400 for me and my husband and we only get to file 3 or our kids at 500 a piece thats 3900. It sounds like a lot but, concidering that our rent is 650 a month, our power ranges from 500 to 650 a month, our 50$ water bill, internet for homescholling is close to 100$ a month, gas in two vehicles, then enough food for 6 children and two adults is an outragous amount by itself, and one more thing that i can think of off the top of my head is household products that we really need, but are now almost non existant in our household. With all of that and a lot more that i didnt put down like insurance both health and 2 vehicles that one time of a total of 3900$ is nowhere near what we need if its just going to be a single payment but a reacurring payment of like 1200 per person a month just for like 6 months to a year or so, would help us make it to a place where we would not have to worry even if the virus spikes back up i really want to get into owning real estate i have studied and watched the pros and im very comfortable with making this happen only thing thats in my way is the first down payment

##      My in-laws are helping with childcare for my oldest, who was supposed to be going to preschool when the baby arrived in March but that was no longer an option we felt safe about. So that is a huge help for us right now.
##      my parents are a huge help with my daughter. we sold a car that we no longer had use for (given neither of us are commuting and won&#39;t for the foreseeable future).
##      The staff at our daughter&#39;s daycare facility were helpful in finding another arrangement for our daughter when their option fell through.

##       Not much. But I can say the teachers and staff have been nothing short of amazing and very understanding. My mother assists me almost daily. She works at a hospital but comes home almost everyday and lets the kids come over to play at her house. One to give me a chance to recharge and start to prepare for tomorrow’s school. I reach out to teachers , doctors, therapists during this time. I am also the PTO president at my 3 youngest children school.
##      Letting kids play at grandparents&#39; to give me time to prepare for my career transition.
##      Sister in law and mother in law
##      Having mother in law here to watch kids
##      My mother watching our kids while I go to my doctor appointments and watching the other kids while one of them has an appointment.</code></pre>

##  Topic 34: 
##       Luckily my children can still go to daycare so we can keep our income and they can socialize and learn.
##      Since I can take off whenever needed without losing my job, it at least will be there when I can begin to work again. Also WIC helping with formula is HUGE bc my youngest couldnt digest breastmilk comfortably.
##      We have more time to work through problems if there are any, and we are also spending much more time together. The children love that (minus when the boys fight). My husband has been having to work from home, so I have also had a bit more help with the children and house chores.
##      I was just approved for unemployment benefits so I can stay home with my children and not pay for childcare. I can also keep my son home doing virtual school rather then send him in person.
##      The children are all home and we can control some outside exposure. Not sure what will happen once school begins since we are being forced to send our children to school 50% of the time based on what our governor is mandating</code></pre>
