##      Trying to work full-time and provide any sort of enriching learning environment for my children.
##      Continuing to work at home and have our children here has been the biggest struggle.  The inner conflict of neglecting my children because I have to be on a call or working and them not receiving the care they should be getting because I&#39;m preoccupied with work (which wouldn&#39;t be a problem if they were at their schools). 
## 
## Our Montessori school is open and our children can attend during this time, but the concern of us (parents) strictly staying home and being quarantined, but then exposing our children to others does not sit well with me.  If we open our doors to allowing our children to be exposed, they could possibly bring something back to our family unknowingly.
##      We can not afford to pay rent. I was watching a couple children throughout the week to supplement income and I can no longer do that. I am a teacher, but the only one in our family with multiple degrees. My husband opted to work so I can stay home and homeschool our girls. I am also pregnant. I don’t know what we’re going to do. I also have concerns about my girls social-emotional development, especially at such a critical point not being able to be out in the environment with other children or people.

I had eviction court last week and I wasn&#39;t even allowed in because i &quot;had a fever of 102&quot; yet i got home and took my temp three times on 2 different thermometers and I was under 98.6. So I literally wasn&#39;t allowed to defend myself, they refused to take or even look at any of our evidence, and they told us we had 30 days and were going to have another court date and then a magistrate made a ruling for my slumlord the next morning. I cannot even find a new place willing to work with us because people assume eviction makes me the trash in this situation but the truth is I almost lost my life in this property and my children have been hurt and even almost seriously hurt as well but this city doesn&#39;t seem to care. Not knowing if you&#39;ll be homeless while covid is still going around us literally terrifying and I can&#39;t believe we got our lives together and came so far to get totally screwed by some garbage person who values a meager amount of money over a family of 4 and their lives and mental and emotional health and I really can&#39;t believe no one seems to care either way.</code></pre>

<pre><code>## 
##  Topic 17: 
##       Worrying about escalating police violence and fascism in our country
##      I’m concerned about exposure. Recently my youngest child had a scheduled doctor appointment and our local children’s hospital didn’t bother to call to inform me the appointment had been rescheduled so I unnecessarily exposed myself and my baby to all kinds of germs.
##      Worry about the fact that im an essential worker that inmay bring this crap home to my kid
##      I am still concerned about exposing my patients to the virus as my husband and I are essential workers and our daughter attends daycare. Also having a difficult time getting clinical placement as a nurse practitioner student due to Covid-19. If I can not get clinical placement, that delays graduation and therefore prevents me from finding a job as a nurse practitioner.
##      Politics. To elaborate-Getting that SOB out of office. I’m more on the republican side but he’s a liar and a bully. That’s not what I want for our country. As much as I hate to say this, we should’ve been just like China and shut it all down for however long it took to eradicate the virus if possible. 
##  Topic 1: 
##       Concerned about rising rate of positive covid tests in our state.
##      The numbers of positive cases in various states going up
##      Rising cases of covid in our state
##      As my state moves into Phase 3 of the risk of covid will increase
##      The number of COVID cases in Arizona continues to rise to record highs. We have continued to quarantine but we feel less safe than ever. 
##  Topic 6: 
##       Staying in the house is driving the  children insane. Prior to COVID-19 we were always outside and now they are bored in the house.
##      Applying for CHIP, not knowing whether we&#39;re eligible, being uninsured in the meantime. Since everyone&#39;s at home in my neighborhood and it&#39;s spring, there&#39;s a lot of loose, aggressive dogs that are not good with children.  I do not feel comfortable letting my kids play in our yard for fear of getting bitten or mauled.  (Not insured, too, remember?) We are essentially prisoners in our own house.
##      Just maintaining mental health as well as physical health. I have gained weight since the pandemic and I’m too afraid to go outside and walk and get exercise due to being scared getting catching the virus!!! Also my baby is tired of being cooped up and I live in a townhouse wit barely any yard so she is kinda tired of that scenery and wants to get out but my fears won’t allow it
##      money and housing and transportation and dental insurance finding a dentist who accepts our badger care insurance
##      Creating a learning environment at home. Creating and sticking to a well rounded schedule that includes learning, creativity and excitement. 
##  Topic 24: 
##       Learning, social/emotional disconnection from friends/family by practicing social distancing
##      Dealing with social isolation and lack of social interaction
##      Socialization skills for my child while social distancing
##      Money and Access to learning materials
##      Bickering. Desire for more structure + social interaction. 
##  Topic 22: 
##       I lost my job, don’t know if I’ll be able to find another job with similar pay in the rural town I live in.
##      I am out of work. I lost my job. I lost my income. I am losing my mind.
##      I don’t know when I will have to return to work. Our daycare shutdown and I don’t know when she will be able to reopen (she has a medically fragile child)
##      I finished my PhD and have no job lined up. My husbands is furloughed and receiving unemployment benefits but we know the expanded benefits have an expiration date and beginning July he will no longer have health insurance through his job. If I don’t find a decent paying position we will have a huge reduction in income.
##      My job security. The uncertainty of when my job will return after COVID 
##  Topic 13: 
##       I&#39;m the survivor of domestic violence, and my 16 month old son and I left my husband before the pandemic began. We&#39;ve been in a very messy divorce, with my ex&#39;s family, himself, and his lawyer being very awful throughout. I&#39;m very worried about my son&#39;s safety wuth my ex and his family (during this pandemic, but also afterward).
##      Our house partially flooded this week and now we have less space and less emotional security in home and a newborn baby set to arrive this week. Birth might in involve a hospital which are concerning at this time.
##      Expecting a new baby during a viral pandemic.
##      Cases spiking as I’m approaching my due date and not excited to have to go to hospital to deliver baby next week
##      My husband is our sole provider and he needs a surgery soon. Him being out of work for a couple weeks and paying for the surgery is concerning. 
##  Topic 4: 
##       Whether to send my daughter to school in the fall and/or whether school will be open
##      Unknown about public school in the fall. Our daughter should begin Kindergarten.
##      Anticipating whether or not to send her to school for in-person instruction this fall.
##      School plans for the fall for my son entering kindergarten.
##      Deciding what to do about school. Whether to go strictly online with our kindergartener. 
##  Topic 21: 
##       My son has started to have some anxiety or fears and it’s troubling to me. For example, he was afraid of the bubbler at the pool where we have started swim lessons again. He cried during lessons and talked about the bubbler on and off for the next four days, even waking up in the morning talking about it. It’s hard to predict what he will be afraid of, and how long it will bother him
##      What the fall will look like. Both myself and my husband work for a school
## District. What will school look like? What will daycare look like? What will be safe?
##      I’m concerned that the USA will never be the same. It seems like fascism is winning while our country is sick with the pandemic and hurting from racial tensions caused by unforgivable police violence.
##      What will happen in September,if it will be a second wave of virus who will take care of my son while I am going to school or studying
##      Our housing problem started before covid but it definitely boiled into a whole bigger issue once this virus hit and even though I have extensive proof of everything that happened, no one, not the city I live in, not the court system in our city, council members in this area, I mean no one seems to care of this slumlord violates every right a tenant is supposed to have. I had eviction court last week and I wasn&#39;t even allowed in because i &quot;had a fever of 102&quot; yet i got home and took my temp three times on 2 different thermometers and I was under 98.6. So I literally wasn&#39;t allowed to defend myself, they refused to take or even look at any of our evidence, and they told us we had 30 days and were going to have another court date and then a magistrate made a ruling for my slumlord the next morning. I cannot even find a new place willing to work with us because people assume eviction makes me the trash in this situation but the truth is I almost lost my life in this property and my children have been hurt and even almost seriously hurt as well but this city doesn&#39;t seem to care. Not knowing if you&#39;ll be homeless while covid is still going around us literally terrifying and I can&#39;t believe we got our lives together and came so far to get totally screwed by some garbage person who values a meager amount of money over a family of 4 and their lives and mental and emotional health and I really can&#39;t believe no one seems to care either way.</code></pre>

##      Having my 2 year old wear a mask, other people wearing a mask in public.
##      Older child (3.5 years old) having anxiety and some toilet training issues/regression.
## General stir craziness. No time to take care of the things we would normally do when the older child is at pre-school.
##      Other family being upset about having to wear a mask around my 2 month old child
##      Keeping our three year old busy, how school will work next year for our three year old and ourselves; we are both educators 
##  Topic 20: 
##       Making sure we have adequate income to sustain ourselves
##      The unknown, decreased salary, unsteady future of employment
##      Making sure we are happy, healthy and have a steady source of income
##      Making sure we treat each other with love and respect.
##      My employment (self employed wedding planner) trying to conceive With fertility issues but access to drs Are slim during this time.

##      Paying electric and water bill
##      Paying my light bill
##      Buying food and paying bills
##      Paying rent and utilities 
##  Topic 3: 
##       Trying to convince my In laws that this is not a hoax and they should be safe. Also trying to convince my husband we shouldn’t see them if they are not being safe.
##      Trying to work full-time and provide any sort of enriching learning environment for my children.
##      Continuing to work at home and have our children here has been the biggest struggle.  The inner conflict of neglecting my children because I have to be on a call or working and them not receiving the care they should be getting because I&#39;m preoccupied with work (which wouldn&#39;t be a problem if they were at their schools). 
## 
## Our Montessori school is open and our children can attend during this time, but the concern of us (parents) strictly staying home and being quarantined, but then exposing our children to others does not sit well with me.  If we open our doors to allowing our children to be exposed, they could possibly bring something back to our family unknowingly.
##      We can not afford to pay rent. I was watching a couple children throughout the week to supplement income and I can no longer do that. I am a teacher, but the only one in our family with multiple degrees. My husband opted to work so I can stay home and homeschool our girls. I am also pregnant. I don’t know what we’re going to do. I also have concerns about my girls social-emotional development, especially at such a critical point not being able to be out in the environment with other children or people.
##      Trying to help them while trying to help myself 
##  Topic 25: 
##       Being unable to get the older child to his OT and other therapies, the uncertainty of what we’re going to do for kindergarten for the older kid and for daycare for the younger kid in the coming months. Very concerned about socialization for kids w them not being able to hang out w other kids their own or similar ages. Concerned about tenants we have being unable to pay rent which means it’s much harder for us to pay our bills.
##      I can’t work from home so I have had to put my kids in someone’s backyard daycare. Nobody wants that for their kids. My kids want school with ECE teachers
##      Just keeping my kids in a routine and allowing them to be kids.
##      Trying to keep kids busy and manage behavior since they cannot go anywhere.
##      Just trying to keep the children, ages 2 &amp; 8, occupied and having fun &amp; learning. Also, finding someone to babysit my kids so I can just go to the grocery store. 
##  Topic 12: 
##       La situación financiera porque no hay ingresos desde el mes de Marzo. La situación emocional de los niños por estar encerrados casi todo el tiempo solo empezaron a salir hace un mes una vez por semana. El miedo al desalojo por falta de pago. Y las deudas que quedan por no pagar.
##      Mi esposo estuvo sin trabajo desde marzo 13 y regreso have 2 semanas. Nos mantuvimos con mi sueldo, pero yo no trabajo duramte el verano porque trabajo en una escuela. Ahora ya no recibo sueldo y el acaba de empezar, nos gastanos buena parte de los ahorros porque solo con mi sueldo no alcanzamos a pagar todos los servicios
##      Antes de que pasara esto del covid 19 mi hijo de 3 años tenía cita en la escuela para aber si lo aceptaban para el año 2020-2021 como niño de necesidades especiales. Esto a puesto en pausa todo y me preocupa todo lo que está pasando ya que mi hijo tiene problemas del corazón.
##      Queria que empesara el kinder y esta todo cerrado. Yo perdi mi trabajo grasias a la pandemia tengo 3 meses sin trabajo.  Tambien me preocupa que mi hijo se comporta agresivo por que no quiero sacarlo afuera a jugar pues temo k pueda infectarse afuera
##      Mi mayor preocupación ahora es el regreso ala escuela tengo mucho miedo que uno que niños se enfermen. Mucho más a mi hijo de 3 años que tuvo cirugía de corazón abierto y tiene condición de corazón. 
##  Topic 9: 
##       Both parents work full time from home and have to simultaneously juggle working with parenting.
##      Temporary work from home when there is an active toddler. It causes my husband stress on his work days
##      Two parents working full-time and taking care of twin infants.
##      Fatigue of parents (grandparents) that are watching my child. I work full-time from home, they are watching her full-time.
##      How to balance work and caring for our very demanding infant 
##  Topic 11: 
##       Agreeing on how we spend our time (alone time ha time together as a couple) and equal division of household duties
##      Too much together time leads to tension &amp; arguments.
##      Finding enough time in the day to fit in schooling via internet, basic household chores (cooking, laundry, cleaning), and spending time playing with our kids.
##      Too much time spent together with too much stress
##      Trying to work full time at home and taking care of my child at the same time. Trying very hard not to let him watch too much tv or play too many video games based on typical pediatric standards.</code></pre>

##  Topic 23: 
##       Finacial Stability, Mental Health, and Emotional Health.
##      Parents’ mental health, kids’ mental health
##      Financial instability, mother/grandma who is our biggest support is in poor health and her healthcare is expensive, I have poor mental health and my child’s father has substance abuse issues and does not provide financial or child care support.
##      The biggest challenges are all mental for me right now. My family as a whole is doing well.
##      Financial, Mental and physical health 
##  Topic 18: 
##       Education. I suffer from adhd and have had to put my own education on hold. My adhd and my eldests suspected autism has made distance education extraordinarily difficult.
##      I am trying to work from home as a 1099 independent contractor doing telepractice speech therapy.  I am working 7 days per week to see half my caseload, and half of the sessions that do occur are rescheduled 2 or 3 times.  This is very distressful to my daughter, who turns 3 this week. My husband is still working outside the home.  On Saturday, I gave in and asked my mother-in-law to help with childcare for 3 days a week, despite our county in our state still being under a stay-at-home order.  I needed to preserve my and my daughter&#39;s mental health.  Unfortunately, this is somewhat risky because my husband works in healthcare.
##      I just need a break. When I chose marriage and kids over my career, I did so without the idea of living in isolation. Not being able to physically see and connect with my peers has a huge impact on my mental health, which in turn negatively affects my ability to balance parenting, educating, housekeeping and all of the other domestic shit that feels thankless and endless. I&#39;ve watched the business that I&#39;ve worked so hard for disintegrate overnight. It&#39;s tough to cope with the fact that my life&#39;s investment in myself feels like a waste right now because I&#39;m stuck in a 1950&#39;s life that I&#39;d be just as capable of living without 11 years of college education and tens of thousands of dollars spent on a business that was supposed to be my balance to ask if the domestic shit I committed to. Now I&#39;m just a fucking housewife.
##      Childcare. I’m scheduled to start a new job next month, a faculty position. I only have a babysitter 3 days per week. My mother-in-law isn’t available 5 days per week. The college plans to open in-person and my department has said it’s “all hands on deck” due to smaller class sizes and needed to give students personalized attention. I’m going to need to be on campus a lot. I’m hoping my grandparents will watch my daughter two days per week, as they did pre-covid, but at the same time it feels super risky due to their age and health histories and me being around groups of people
## On campus.
##      Our financial problems have increased which is putting a HUGE strain on our marriage. We are stressed and angry and taking it out on each other. His stress is causing him to be depressed and in turn he is drinking WAY more which is causing problems between us as well. 
##  Topic 19: 
##       Getting my husband’s unemployment check. Still haven’t received it.
##      Receiving unemployment has been a nightmare. Still waiting.
##      worried about if my husband gets called back to work and we have no childcare possibilities. also, i&#39;m very concerned about when federal expanded unemployment benefits will run out.
##      Trying to get my spouses unemployment.  Filed 3/20 and haven&#39;t received a dime yet
##      The children aren&#39;t getting any social time. I don&#39;t k ow why we havent recieved our stimulus check yet. 
##  Topic 15: 
##       Helping my child move forward with his IEP goals, especially the social/emotional and speech.
## 
## Trying to explain to him what’s going on since he knows about the looting and rioting in the twin cities area and we are close to it.
## 
## Trying to figure out if we think it’s a good idea for my hubby’s job to be reopening.
## 
## Coping with our child finally going through the “no” phase. It’s developmentally important but making things really hard on us right now.
## 
## We’re on edge. I totally panicked last night when I noticed a vehicle creeping up slowly, shining a flashlight on the laundromat across the street and into the dark and bushy areas surrounding it. It took several minutes, but eventually it pulled away and I saw it was a Sheriff’s vehicle. A few days back I heard lots of honking and wondered if it was rioters. It turned out being a graduation celebration, but took about 10 minutes for me to figure that out and it was alarming. That’s twice this week I’ve found myself trying to peek out my window without being in front of my window because I didn’t know if it was safe.
##      Finding a safe and affordable location away from looting, rioting, fireworks, gunshots, protests,  homelessness epidemic, failed schools, overpriced housing and failed public institutions/government.  All of these negative trends have been significantly accelerated by the Covid crisis.  Urban centers are now VERY dangerous and VERY unhealthy places for people especially people with kids.  It is very clear that our child has been traumatized by a combination of being forced inside by the pandemic while watching protesters and rioters from the window.  He has a sound sensitivity and the gunshots and fireworks are pretty constant after dark.
## 
## Where to go though is the million $ question.  I have lived in the DC city core for 20+ years so it is very daunting to have to plan to evacuate your home you have loved for such a long time especially during a pandemic.  I wish I were joking or exaggerating.  I am not.  Even a good bit of the food supply chain continues to break down on a weekly basis.  It is insane.  Instead of fixing these issues, our mayor is running for Vice President and our city council has proposed raising taxes???????
##      Well, we just found out Saturday that or landlord has notified the homeowners across the street that they will be tearing down our building to build a 300-unit apartment complex here instead. There was no date on the postcard saying when construction would begin, but we can&#39;t afford anywhere else it looks like and the idea of moving with a newborn is daunting.
##      We had been looking forward to our vacation. We had been offered by friends (whom we work with and share a bubble with) to join them at a house on the beach in Outerbanks with their family. We had been monitoring the situation of COVID cases as they rise for the past several weeks with alarm. This was to be a very special and rare vacation for us and we’ve been watching it slip away. It had been a bright spot for us to look forward too. We even asked our family doctor what his professional opinion was and he concluded that as long as we were smart we would probably be fine. And even though the county we would be visiting has had a total of only 16 cases this entire time, we were put into an ultimatum. Two weeks before we were to leave, NYS put together a list of states that residents were banned from traveling to unless they quarantined. Added to that if we were to get sick afterward we could be fined up to $10,000 and no paid sick time. This was confirmed my our employer (my husband and I work for the same place) we could take our week vacation but would need to take the two week Mandatory quarantine without pay. That would mean we would lose two paychecks just for a week of leisure. The remote possibility that we could jeopardize the financial safety of our family through fines and no paychecks, petrified us. We chose to back out. Two of the most stressful and hard parts of this process have been the complexity of feelings that come from being forced into a situation. We were taking so many precautions to do this correctly, but that didn’t matter, the state had layed out their blanket rules. I never knew I would have to make a decision this heavy over a vacation! The second hardest part is dealing with the social repercussions, which not aLot of people talk about now. We didn’t know how this would affect our friendship. They are still trying to figure out a way to go... they have the right to make their own decisions, but we didn’t know if they would resen
##      The fact there there is looting and rioting in our city, we had to choose between staying in quarantine or leaving and going to somewhere safer. We left to go to my parents (kids grandparents) because of the riots. 
##  Topic 7: 
##       This month we really felt the budget crunch. Have been feuding kids rather than myself. Obviously when I’m hungry it’s more likely to be a bad day for everyone as I am tired cranky and less patient. While
## My husbands makes a good paycheck we have had a hard time meeting minimum payments and we already maxed out on our credit card early on in the pandemic April/May ish
##      Watching coworkers lose funded positions, anticipated pay cuts, my property taxes already have doubled, I don’t know if I will be able to afford my student loan payment.
##      Credit card debt due to years of living paycheck to paycheck and student loan debt of $90k.
##      Marital conflict. This has been really hard on our already shakey marriage
##      Lack of housing. We couldn&#39;t find a place to rent because lack of a job, but then my husband got a job but no rentals available in the price range we could afford. Plus the money we had saved for a deposit, was used for living expenses while not working.</code></pre>

##  Topic 16: 
##       Traveling out of state to see our families.  We are a military family and the unknown about when it is safe to see our extended family creates uncomfortable conversations with them.  Some extended family members do not take the virus seriously and are judging our concerns for traveling in the future.
##      Our family lives to travel, visit family, and go to the playground and Disney. My daughters are saying they are sad missing family and ask to go to the park to play and try to see other children on the few occasions that they are out.
##      Unable to visit family &amp; friends... general feeling of isolation from those outside our family
##      When all of this will be “over” we haven’t been seeing family or friends and we are running out of things to pass the time. We all miss seeing extended family and it is difficult to explain the odd nuance to our children.
##      We are dealing with the loss of a few family members. Mourning and grieving 
##  Topic 10: 
##       Not being able to go to the park, public pool, or able to take the kids out in general.
##      Not being able to take my kids to public places like parks and playgrounds
##      People masking up and taking NJs restrictions seriously.
##      Our state and local leadership regarding COVID is sorely lacking. Our state is seeing a big increase in cases and many people seem to think we are past the pandemic and are not taking safety precautions. I don’t trust the way our community is handling this crisis.
## 
##      Not being able to go on playdates with friends or just be out in public.  My child is a social butterfly and thrives on contact with people.  Without that, she becomes whiny, clingy, and grumpy.  I also benefit from having mom friends, but that hasn&#39;t happened either since the pandemic.</code></pre>

##      If we report back to school/work, are they going to provide us teachers with protective gear?  How often are they really going to deep clean?  Yes, my janitor cleaned very well, but really she is going to deep clean every day?  Who is going to clean in between classes?  Am I and the students going to have to clean between classes?  Is the district going to provide me with cleaning products?  Should I start stocking up my own cleaning products?  Should I wear scrubs along with other protective gear instead of regular clothing due to its antibacterial technology even though it is against the employee handbook? Guess I should start ordering that stuff now. 
## What if we stay working from home?  I need to purchase things to help make my set up better than from the spring.  The district &amp; board members already voted that teachers are not getting a stipend or pay raise and our pay scale has been frozen.  They also voted that teachers will not be getting an allowance for at-home technology so I have to buy my own things.

##  Topic 2: 
##       We took the risk of exposure to covid19 because we participated in a protest against police brutality
##      I live just north of a major city hot spot, about 30 minutes away. We were pretty fine here until the most recent spike, our county saw numbers rise. I work at an eye doctors office and this week we’ve had so many more patients calling to cancel appointments because they’ve been exposed to covid or have contracted it themselves. I thought our quiet little town was pretty safe but I think those cases from the big city are starting to creep up here. I pray that we are all safe when we eventually contract it!!!!
##      My wife and I have been going to work during this pandemic.  We both work in healthcare and we have been lucky to not have gotten COVID.  We have only had 2 patients who were diagnosed with COVID and exposure to our clinic was very unlikely.. But with the increase in cases, we are seeing more patients contracting the virus.
##      Now, I’m concern about the looting, robbing sue to the protests and the curfew imposed to the city.
##      It has been doubly complicated lately because my husband is a police Officer and had to work a protest march. More stress has come from that than Covid lately, but there has also been worry because of Covid numbers creeping up here in Michigan.
##      The riots and protests (when not peaceful) are more concerning to us. But I am stressing less about that also since I have started limiting my social media intake this week. The potty training and things with my husband have been my stressors this week.
##      It’s been on the back burner this week due to increased concerns with the protests, riots, and city unrest.
##      I am concerned about being exposed at work and bringing it home to my children. I am in direct contact with Co-Vid patients weekly.
##      My grandma is in a nursing home and one of her aides contracted the virus. They gave it to her and she’s 94 in the hospital with no allowed visitors. The only communication we have with her is through FaceTime. It’s very scary for her to be alone and confused.
##      Being at home with few distractions and no other input from other caregivers for several weeks made me a better parent. I became more consistent with discipline and more aware of my kids’ needs.</code></pre>

##      It has been very hard not being able to take time off to be with my children. My sister who watches them doesn’t really play with them. So they are on the iPad or watching tv all day. Which is not useful at all.
##      It&#39;s hard. We are really well situated to get through this, and it&#39;s still really, really hard. We are mostly homebodies, and we still are getting cabin fever, and it&#39;s hardest on the kids - we think if the 4-year-old could just be able to go somewhere else and play with other kids, he&#39;d have a much easier time, and spa would we - he just can&#39;t blow off steam like he would normally be able to

##      I apologise for the black spots on this survey. Filing it out on my phone and there simply was no keyboard, so I couldn&#39;t answer some of the questions.
##      It has actually brought us closer together.
##      Being together has made us actually grow closer
##      It has been a wake up call and brought us closer together.
##      Brought the family closer together
##      Overall it&#39;s been fine- great, actually, because we&#39;ve been able to spend time together as a family and grow closer as we play and work together. We&#39;ve been blessed to be safe and not gotten sick.</code></pre>

##      My son is starting kindergarten and I’m considering holding him back because I want him to have a “normal” start to kindergarten
##      I am worried about the school system In the fall. I do not believe that he should be homeschooled but the school has not shared with me a plan besides first day of school.

##  Topic 34: 
##       Unsure how to get/convince child to wear face mask as mandated by many places (including doctor&#39;s office for well-child visit)
##      I had thought we would make it through unscathed. I was also shocked at the number of people not following our MA guidance on mask wearing and social distancing.
##      We do not understand the irresponsibility of others that don’t wear masks and that don’t social distance.
##      I can&#39;t believe how many people won&#39;t wear a mask because they believe it causes respiratory problems and it&#39;s infringing upon their &quot;rights.&quot;
##      My husband, who is Asian, is starting to feel unsafe in public spaces, especially ones that are primarily white. He was scared to enter a restaurant that had a few middle aged white people standing outside, not wearing masks. He wears a mask but felt he would be targeted for doing so. When he entered the restaurant, it was packed, all white people, no social distancing, no masks. Even the workers weren&#39;t wearing masks, and I believe they&#39;re required by law to by state law. But we didn&#39;t report them, he just left quickly and we went somewhere else. But I think it&#39;s significant that this is the first time my husband has felt scared and unsafe just for not being white in a place full of white people.
##      frustrating that people in general won&#39;t wear masks and social distance for the greater good of all.  Americans are very selfish
##      I wish people would actually follow the Executive Orders as they&#39;re written (medical exemptions for masks, masks only required if within 6 feet, etc) instead of making up their own versions. For example, I&#39;ve been harassed because I wasn&#39;t wearing a mask when I was just trying to get a drink at a large convenience store. It was midnight and there were only two other people in the building. They were both wearing a mask, sitting behind plexiglass and more than 20 feet away from me. The CT order says masks are to be worn if you&#39;re closer than 6 feet, but if you have a medical reason it&#39;s not required.
##      We have been largely unaffected aside from the social media posts in our small town. We social distance, wear masks, and largely stay indoors. The only difference now is, when we do go out, if we see there’s a lot of people around, we won’t go and do the things we were planning to.
##      How frustrating it is to see people refuse to wear masks or take precautions
##      wear masks and follow social distancing</code></pre>

##  Topic 37: 
##       We have however gotten alot closer w/ one another as we have had family night every night&amp;day for several months now so even when we get frustrated and on edge or just plain sick of 1 another then we have learned 2 handle and properly deal w/ it and other issues so its exactly how any and all families shld and are supposed 2 be like.......there for each other through the good and bad and rough and unknown times no matter what or who or why or where. Seems this world had very lil or no morals and family members seemed always apart or never 2gether 4 whatever reason or excuse these days and in the new generation of people and so now we&#39;re all being forced or ordered 2 be 2gether everyday and every night s and i miss that about the way i was brought up. Now we work 2 gether and are there 4 one another regardless of if we want 2 be or not so being forced 2 be home and 2gether and problem solve 2gether is strengthening our family in a huge way and it brings some comfort and familiar feelings of growing up learning 2 work 2gether, play 2gether, eat 2gether etc. Vs. Nobody ever being home 2spend that time 2gether or every1 just storming out or going 2 work or friends and family members when they felt like it or were irritated w/ one another or having 2 work all day everyday and couldnt spend time 2gether. So therefore i myself have learned in my many rough yrs how 2 find good in almost all areas of life and especially in such ugly times and places and people and uncertain and unpredictable times as these its a great skill 2 have because i feel I&#39;d be depressed very deeply and irreversibly if i couldnt notice and savor the good and beauty that such a scary and ugly thing can n does and will bring. Ive always been 1 to adapt easily and quickly so 4 that i thank the good lord above because w/ out it I&#39;d be a total wreck and stress ball and basketcase right now. Amen
##      One good thing: a good way to slow everybody down and focus on what matters
##      being coparents with a family of antivax conspiracy theorists is a wild ride.
##      It&#39;s been a wild ride but we&#39;re riding it out
##      It would be super great if we could get antibody testing en masse.
##      Worst experience ever
##      This has been the worst experience of my life. I naively never realized how truly little control I have over anything and how people “above” me can shut things down at a moments notice (even when medical reports being based off of are faulty and/or incomplete, but how serious decisions that affect millions and millions are made in knee jerk reaction) - realizing the power that government and organizations have, and how much us “little people” are considered nothing more than a potential contagion carrier, has been devastating to me. My extreme loneliness in all this has come not just from the physical distancing, but also the psychological distancing from each other. It’s been such a destruction to humanity. I deeply miss when we could see people as people, and not just as a collection of gross germs to avoid.
##      This has been a tremendous learning experience for us as we’ve learned to cope with one another being home all the time and practice a lot of patience!
##      This is the worst thing to experience.
##      It&#39;s been a learning experience. We have learned how to slow down and be okay with relaxing, while still keeping some kind of daily routine.</code></pre>

##  Topic 39: 
##       I say our income decreased but I was only substitute teaching so it wasn’t substantial. My husbands job hasn’t changed, he is simply working from home.
##      My daughter and I require pool therapy bi-weekly to control our chronic joint pain. Months going without this medical assistance has been excruciating.  But we&#39;re alive and not sick...so I cannot complain too much :)
##      We were very fortunate to keep our jobs and be able to work from home.
##      We are fortunate because we are able to still provide for ourselves unlike others that are not as fortunate.
##      Again, we recognize our privilege. Not only do we have the flexibility to work from home, but we have benefits such as paid sick leave and quality health insurance. Although my partner came to the U.S four years ago from South America, he has a green card so has not been impacted by the xenophobic and racist policies in the last few months.
##      Even with our large income, we pay for my in-laws house too, so we are stretched thin.  Trying to pay for childcare or a teacher if school closes may cost my entire salary.  Then do I quit?  Take Fmla?
##      There has definitely been some challenges but we are in a fortunate position that our income hasn’t been affected and our childcare needs can be met as I’m still on maternity leave.
##      It&#39;s hard to keep a toddler at home specially because we used to go to the park everyday . We walked  around the neighborhood.  It was hard for him to stay inside at the beginning now he is watching more TV than the usual.  Our income decreased dramatically my husband lost his job and I decided to stop working . I didn&#39;t want to be exposed to the Virus and that was  probably the best decision for our family even though we knew it was going to be hard to survive. Better be safe than sorry.
##      It fortunately hasn’t had a huge impact on my family.
