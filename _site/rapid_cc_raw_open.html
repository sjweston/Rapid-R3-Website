I am worried about any side effects.","Just the thought that we will have to continuously have to get booster shots","Yes side effects not sure it does what they say","Yes, I don’t feel like it was tested long enough to know long term effects","none","No concern","No","I have lupus and im on immune suppressants so i wasnt sure how my body would handle it","Yes.  Concerns about its efficacy, that there are no long term studies of this particular vaccine or its effects on pregnancy/fetuses.  No proof of long term efficacy, or the efficacy of the vaccine over acquired immunity / lack of availability to test for antibodies (therefore forcing a vaccine on the population), trials that have small test groups/lack diversity in test groups.  In general reading all reports of mortality COVID seems to affect the elderly and those with co-morbidities (our state will be discontinuing age reporting sadly) I see no need to vaccinate myself against something that a)could have been avoided had we had a government that had taken this seriously, had a pandemic response team, required mask wearing and did not provide hosts for the virus b)health and safety practices that can limit exposure or increase natural immunity/defenses.  Our family has children that are neurodiverse and have chronic life threatening illnesses we already abstain from vaccinations as no specialist in several states has been able to guarantee zero side effects.","Future complications","Losing time from work unpaid if ill after 2nd shot","I have concerns over my infant receiving it. I worry about her being so little.","None","I don't feel enough testing has been conducted and no one has spoke of the side effects in enough detail.","Long term effects.","No","Yes side effects","Not happy with the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I don’t trust the company after the law suit for their baby powerd","no","Yes, still in an experimental stage.","Side effects","I wonder how safe it really is","No","Yes.  I am a very reactive person, with many allergies.  I've had anaphylactic reactions to flu vaccinations before. I'm concerned about having a reaction and the side effects, due to lack of research and time available to spend on learning about safety of the vaccine.","Long term effects","No.","No","No","Getting sick or getting a bad reaction from it","The only concern I have is nervousness about the side effects....not looking forward to them.","I think it came out a lot sooner than other vaccines which worries me a little. I'm also hesitant to have my one year old vaccinated","How often need to obtain booster. Which is really over best for all aspects:1. Reducing likelihood of transmitting, reducing illness if contact it, and protection on variances","We have already had the virus, so don’t see the necessity in getting a vaccine.","I have concerns about the effectiveness of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine","Side effects","How safe it really is","I am concerned about possible side effects from the vaccine","N/a","Yes. It was just developed so quickly.","No","Might interfere with ongoing fertility treatments","Yes side effects","No","Reactions or death.","None","Having side effects","I want to see studies on how it works with young children before getting it for my kids.","No","I'm worried about long term effects","I have an allergy that could prevent me from getting shot depending on ingredients","I am pregnant so I waited until my second trimester","Yes  Not enough info as far as a track record","It hasnt been tested long enough","No","Side effects","None","No","No","No","No","Not sure about it","No worries just curious if I will be needing it annually","Just dont want to because it hasnt been out long enough","I don't want to get vaccinated because I want to see how other people react to it and there's a 99.75% survival rate","No","What are the side affects","Side effects tend to hit me hard","No","There is no proven fact that the vaccine really works. There’s not information on the vaccine","I am immune compremised and too worried not enough research is available regarding side effects","There have not been very many trials that include children or breastfeeding mothers so it’s like going in blind","No","Not enough research, it was developed extremely quickly so I don’t trust it","Side effects and effectiveness","Not really. I’m very afraid of needles so I’m not looking forward to it, but that’s any vaccine or blood draw for me. Nothing specific to the COVID vaccine.","Yes, potential dmside effects since it was developed so quickly","No","My son and I have ElhosDanlos, my daughter demonstrated allergies.

Meaning, hospitals cannot be overwhelmed and saturated/overworked.","Unsure of long term effects","None","No","A bit concerned because it was rolled out very fast and have heard and known of people getting side effects.","Let's see how others do first","Fertility","Yes, side effects and longevity of the vaccination","Until more research is done with young children, I am going to wait for them.","Yes allergic reaction","always concerned about putting manmade chemicals/treatments in my body","No"]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Week<\/th>\n      <th>State<\/th>\n      <th>Below 1.5xFPL<\/th>\n      <th>RaceGroup<\/th>\n      <th>ProviderAge<\/th>\n      <th>Child 0-3<\/th>\n      <th>Response<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"autoWidth":true,"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":0}],"order":[],"orderClasses":false,"orderCellsTop":true}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

It’s impossible for working parents to work and home school.","It has been tough, but we're grateful for what we received.","Pass the stimulus bill we need it","Kids being able to go to childcare or school would allow me to work more, and then I could pay for food and rent","I need for the politicians to follow the best science available to help help rid us of Covid 19.","As a child care worker working in person and risking our lives, it would be nice to be appreciated and to get hazard pay instead of a pay cut!","Mainly we are fine.","That increased vaccine supply and stimulus checks would greatly help americans","recognition as an essential worker, since I stayed open to provide childcare for hospital workers, grocery workers","I need to trust that they are making the right decisions based on science","Yes","I qualified for unemployment, yet couldn't access via phone or online.  More people need to be hired to assist the unemployment department.","I do home daycare and so I need things to go back to normal so that I can have a full house of children once again right now parents are scared to come to the daycare's and some are losing their jobs from week to week and so I just never know what my aunt come is going to look like I have never had this problem before because I have always had a full house and I've always known my income from week to week.","Get kids back to school.  More money is always helpful.  We have what we need, but the budget is tight.","Less involvement of government","I really don't have any issue i will any elected officials to help me with","Childcare workers need to be above people who can work from home on the vaccination list. I know so many people who have gotten their first shot despite being able to continue staying at home whereas I have yet to ever been able to get a date of when I will be able to.","The need for mental health care at an affordable rate is high.","Either pay everyone or open everything back up. My mom been out since November from covid almost died and still no assistance to pay any of her bills","Struggling","Getting extra $ would help.  Where we are now, if hours are cut more, we will not be on time with our bills.","Lots of families are struggling and no one can get help from unemployment due to backed up phone calls, and losing children due to covid and quarantine rules. We have to decide if we go without payment from families during quarantine or make them pay when  they are not here","To keep our borders closed, which will prevent more covid coming in","We need support for FCCH. We need FCCH to official become a \"profession\". FCCH providers have worked tirelessly to keep our economy going for essential workers. We are getting very minimal support from our state/federal government. We had to advocate to be recognized as essential during a pandemic, when centers and schools were closing!","We are struggling. Crazy thing to think about is finding a way for families to pay off credit card debt brought on by covid closures and medical bills without having to file bankruptcy and loose their hones","Continue increase in snap.give 6 month financial assistant","I have 2 kids that are in college that didn’t get stimulus money and I didn’t get any for them because of their ages. My son was living in an off campus apartment, but his job was ordered closed and he didn’t receive unemployment, so he had to move back home. My daughter has college expenses that we’re struggling to cover. Their mental health is suffering from all the stress.","Get all children into schools so families can be normal","Living wage for all, medical insurance for all and vaccine given to essential works all ages in earliest tiers.","I have heard  a lot of people saying they are struggling with the extra tax burden incurred from the extra unemployment money","We need there to be a clear and concise  plan that all states follow so that we can stop spreading this virus and allowing it to mutate - cut off access to hosts by having all states follow the same protocols - or limit travel between states that have no loose protocols. Get vaccines out to everyone who is eligible and willing.","Release the funds quickly without complex barriers to small businesses","We need the vaccine to be available to ALL essential workers.","Help us keep the economy going","Better internet so we are not dropping out of class so much.  3 online students plus meetings make it hard sometimes. Some areas are assisting in internet bills but I have not heard of that in Georgia.","We need affordable housing in our area","summer, we had free food, now we dont","College loan dept relief","This is an extremely stressful time for families and financially hard!","Please kickstart economy so we can begin to move forward.

I’m a small business and still can’t get the PPP I need to not close after 35 years of business","Continue to work for the all American people and work to bring back manufacturing of products and food back to America.","Would like more transparency about the experimental drug for Covid. Not convinced at this point of its future safety. Once I feel comfortable about it I'll take it.","I would like for them to know that childcare reimbursement rates need to be increased.","Thank you. this isn't an easy time for any of us and you not  only have us to process but your our families too. I also was hoping that perhaps we could find ways to work with Mental Heath people along with their families issues as this could be a scary time for them too.","Please make it easier to get SSDI. It is ridiculous that I should consider suicide so often, simply because I am broke. I do not understand why the govt doesn’t want me to be a successful part of society. If I could get on disability income and sort out my mental health issues, maybe I could get better and go to school. Maybe someday I could be an active participant in the American economy. The fact of the matter is that I will never get the chance to have dreams or a future of any kind because America treats people like money-making machines instead of human beings. I am disabled. I am more disabled than a lot of people who collect SSDI. What’s the deal? Fix it. I’m dying.","I have filled in for teachers since the Safer at Home orders in WI last year.  I have put my health, and my families health at risk.  I don't have health insurance that is affordable, I'm sinking in medical bills, I have 100% of my business income leaving at the end of summer.  Although I can re-enroll, there will be large gaps in enrollment, and therefore income.  I'm at a tipping point right now of trying to figure out how to stay in business, how to serve families, where to put my efforts.  We were essential!  Everyone needed us and applauded us.  Until we weren't.  Early Childhood Education in Family Child Care is the most overlooked of programs dealing with young children.  After 28 years of serving families, with no retirement, no investments, and unable to continue to afford health insurance... I'm not sure what I am going to do.  We do not get paid enough to plan for the future.  Yet families just cannot pay us more and survive in the now.  It's a really large mess.","We need schools open, kids are falling behind, hate virtual learning","Clear directions and enforcement of measures to provide safety","?","Policy makes badly underestimate the costs needed to survive. My family did not experience financial hardships, but so many around me did and it was heartbreaking. Policy makes are so out of touch with modern costs.","Education is vital. Paying teachers is important and as a teacher with experience I should be a value to my school. I have not been able to feel valued during this time.","Help is essential and needed and that we are in a lot of debt and need all the help we can get.","That people are still struggling and getting more and more discouraged every day.","Need more vaccines","monthly childcare credits for working families","Let us make the informed decision for ourselves and live with the consequences. I follow the laws and mandates because I have to but I think it's causing me more damage that doing me good. My mental health has been way worse this year.","Change in tax laws so medium to low income families reduced taxes and wealthy and corporations pay taxes","I would like to see the resumption of normal activity. I believe we are engaged in a massive and destructive overreaction to Covid-19.","That middle class is struggling too.","Please stop the bickering amongst parties ..exhibit compassion for fellow Americans.","Better vaccine distribution in my state","More supper","I am a college student living with my parents. I didn’t receive a stimulus check and they didn’t receive one for me. I am unable to work full time due to chronic illness. Things sucked before covid and the obstacles are even greater now.","That we need more financial and emotional support","No","Dependent stimulus check","Child care workers need better health insurance options. All my income goes to my bills and I have nothing left for insurance. I’m period. Just because I make $38000 a year does not mean I can pay $350 a month just to have insurance and then pay to go to the doctor and for whatever care I get. That’s ridiculous .","This has been a terrifying time to be a teacher. I am constantly afraid of getting my students or my coworkers sick. I have felt so undervalued and underapreciated, while at the same, we are told that we are essential for the economy to reopen.","More vaccine widely available","Just freedom to do our jobs","Things to get back to normal","Need help with utilities","Working towards feeling safe.","Fix poverty and low income housing.","Extra food benefits should be permanent for senior  citizens","We are lost. We are scared. We need help.","I work in live entertainment normally (childcare is my current survival job). Don’t forget about us. We can’t work because it isn’t safe and we aren’t essential and we are STRUGGLING.","We are both teachers. We love our students and have worked very hard during the pandemic. A lot of politicians have spoken very negatively about teachers and it has been very disheartening.","Nothing","We are fortunate to still have jobs, my husband is working from home - which probably has been the hardest for him. The kids are slowly going to back to school and I have seen them happier, and grades have improved.","We are a paycheck to paycheck family and we always have to pay taxes because of how things look on paper but we can’t qualify for any refi program to help us pay off debt","We need more vaccines","The goverment elected officials are not working in the best interest for the people of America. Far too much fear is felt by people because of the uncertainty of the bills that are being passed. Fear foradults is also felt by children.","Im struggling and so are the children and just because im only a ffn provider it doesnt mean i shouldnt get some of this relief funds too and not just ingnored like i dont even exist .      er","Better faster vaccine rollout","We are ok and grateful for any help we can get","Friends family are needed","Families have always needed to be supported, but through these unprecedented times lack of support will be detrimental in the development of young learners. We need to have access to vaccines, testing and medical care regardless of medical insurance. If this pandemic has not taught our country that we must provide universal healthcare I do not know what could. Health is precious, and I mean physical and mental and we must ensure that everyone has access to healthcare services.","Pass the $15 minimum wage. Over time it will drive up wages for people making 18-20/ hour as well","More help here and less overseas","Just sending us any time of funds is good for me. I’m a grateful person, so whatever I get I’m happy with it.","Families could use more support fiscally and in community resources to return to pre-pandemic ways of living.","We need investments in ECE that are substantial enough to trickle down to educators. Educators need fair compensation and benefits for the work that they do. No one can live on preschool teacher pay.","Confined family leave support. Not having paid family leave available makes emergencies crippling. I lost my husband to cancer pre-pandemic and I was barely able to keep us above water while he was sick. We have to have an Avenue to receive support while caring for family","The health of the general population is of the upmost importance. To ensure that health the general population needs access to shelter, food, and water. The government needs to step in and insure these needs are met","No","We are taking dau by day.","That they suck and that they worry about the wrong things and spread hatred","Continue to make noncompetetive grants available.","Keep Covid restrictions, please.  It is working, and it makes me feel more secure going to work when i can be sure that the government cards about my and my co-workers' health and safety.","Everyone is suffering financially","It won’t make a difference.","We NEED better wages. It's sad that I can work full time with a degree and still qualify for medicaid. Earnings are way tooooo low","It’s hard to try and keep things normal for my children when the income is a lot less and we are having trouble keeping up with the rent and bills so much that there’s no more Friday night pizza or ice cream runs","We are so sick that our country is so divided","More free resources for mental health","Better health care and vaccines","We need financial support from the government; a better vaccination process (our state, GA, ranks last in the rollout and is sitting on a million doses); the government’s help in making employers/corporations improve ventilation and enforce masking, social distancing, etc.","More money","My work is reduced, and I am in a high risk group. If I take a crappy job, I can't get benefits &amp; I might catch the virus. Families need help. You habe to also be available for your kids.","Even though I don’t qualify for government assistance during normal times, it would be beneficial during this pandemic","To know people need help for basic needs","The kids I care for and the ones I parent who have special needs are falling behind. My preschool was set up to support different needs of children but cannot get a PPP loan due to being a micro business and me being just one person. I live next to domestic abuse with children, yet social services are so burned out they won't even bother to check on the children there even with multiple reports from myself and police. Anxiety even in neurotypical children is skyrocketing, but adults who are forced to parent in a vacuum have no emotional surplus left between either working in unsafe conditions or struggling to fight the unemployment system and worrying over how to juggle bills to avoid shut off. Services for special needs kids are swamped. Mental health services are swamped. This country's back bone is bending beyond what can be recovered from. We need help with healthcare, with school supports, with early education supports/grants/loans, with the ability to work 40 hours a week and not have to rely on welfare. Covid has taken every inequality in this country and multiplied it by a million. It's hard to cheer a rocket to mars when basic science about disease vectors and prevention is ignored here on earth.","Unfair that people laid off were paid more than those of us forced to work thru pandemic.","Need to get vaccinated! Need better access to affordable healthcare","Yes","Higher wages in childcare","Mental health has been a big concern with trying to juggle home life and sense of normalcy","To care about us","Nothing","Not the best","Child care grants to help our small business","Reduce taxes, keep overall prices down.  The stimulus check is making employment hard.","I don’t need anything at this time. Other families need assistance because they are affected by lack of income, childcare and businesses being closed.","we are struggling and most politicians are NOT.  Its frustrating that those who are NOT in need are making the decisions for those in need!"]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Week<\/th>\n      <th>State<\/th>\n      <th>Below 1.5xFPL<\/th>\n      <th>RaceGroup<\/th>\n      <th>ProviderAge<\/th>\n      <th>Child 0-3<\/th>\n      <th>Response<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"autoWidth":true,"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":0}],"order":[],"orderClasses":false,"orderCellsTop":true}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

The conditions of the industry have driven many out. We are in a staffing crisis on top of an unprecedented demand for childcare availability.

I do not do regular \"work from home\" I risk my health and the health of my assistant every day because we are invested early childhood educators. Elected officials need to do their part to support us and make sure that we start to make a livable wage, that the cost of operating our program has increased exponentially and we have become elementary and often times middle school teachers as we are the ones supporting the distance learners with their academic endevours. We must be supported financially so we can continue to operate, we make way below minimum wages and we have to turn around and pay our assistants at least the minimum wage-which is an insult because they deserve to make something comparable to the salary of a kindergarten-elementary school teacher because they have performed as such through this pandemic. Many of us do NOT have medical benefits and have to commute across the border to have our m medical issues take care of, and that is outrageous.","More vaccines, increased training requirements should come with more educational support","More financial help to small facilities that aren’t government funded","More funding and respect needed now","Hazard pay for childcare providers","Resources(health dept and educational) and support for childcare workers.","We need to be seen as educators.

Without our services, the rest of the country cant open up.  However, we feel like we are getting the short end of the stick.  We have been operating, prior to vaccination, for nine months on the frontline.  However, it is \"too risky\" for schools to open with fully vaccinated staff.  It is a double standard which just shows the lack of respect given to the early education community.  Please think of the people who your policies are affecting.","Child care providers need higher pay","Struggling","We need access to mental health professionals for children and adults","It’s not going to make any difference","Teachers need to more thought. We are exposed daily. Early ed teachers do not get hazard pay or essential pay. We work with one of the most worrisome age. Children that do not know how to cover germs and many things go in the mouth still. We are providing care so parents can work. We are essential but vulnerable","Children are not guinea pigs and just because you think COVID might not affect them doesn’t mean that you can send them back to school with little precautions","We needed supplies last year!  Last Spring first responders (police, fire dept, teachers) received sanitizer, etc and we home child care providers were told 'NO' when we asked for supplies.","More free mental health resources","Need to get back to normal","INVEST IN CHILDCARE AND PROVIDERS. If local schools had enough money to improve their ventilation, fully staff the premises to cover sick leaves, enforce masks and health screenings, vaccinate employees, etc., I would still be in the classroom where I can best serve children who need me most.","I'm tired","Working families need more resources thaey can actually qualify for","That we are essential and often feel like we don’t have enough support.","How hard it is for parents to work without affordable &amp; available child care","We need funding. We need access to support services. We need non starvation wages for everyone but especially for childcare providers who are doing their best to mitigate the very real challenges of raising a family without a village. We need an overhaul of how preschool is looked at, it isn't all letters or grades it is about developing the entire child.","I think pay should be a high priority.  We are one of the lowest paid employees, and have a huge impact on children's lives.  Finding and keeping quality teachers at minimum wage is hard.","Going off of net income for all the government aid to businesses doesn’t make any sense. Self employed use their gross to pay expenses. The pandemic didn’t make our expenses go away. And figuring out unemployment on net in Illinois when everyone else goes by gross is purposefully rigging the system so we get paid less.","Pay raises","To effectively role our vaccines as soon as possible.","More money","None","I’m not doing the best but I’m trying","Help","We need help. We need more resources and for our job to be taken seriously. In Massachusetts vaccinations are available to teachers and early childhood educators and the system is so messed up the officials are telling us they don’t know when we can get our vaccinations. In order for us as providers to keep everyone safe and healthy we must be healthy.","ppe","Realize that childcare is IMPORTANT to all working people, not just parents.","We keep the economic world running.
