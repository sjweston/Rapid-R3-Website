<p>These analyses are based on responses collected from 7427 caregivers between the dates of April 06, 2020 and August 13, 2020. These caregivers represent a range of voices: 9.22% are Black/African American, 18.92% are LatinX, and 29.10% live at or below 1.5 times the federal poverty line. Proportions/percentages are calculated based on the item-level response rates, not out of the total sample size. The data for these analyses are <em>not</em> weighted.</p>
