It had been a bright spot for us to look forward too. We even asked our family doctor what his professional opinion was and he concluded that as long as we were smart we would probably be fine. And even though the county we would be visiting has had a total of only 16 cases this entire time, we were put into an ultimatum.

The remote possibility that we could jeopardize the financial safety of our family through fines and no paychecks, petrified us. We chose to back out.
