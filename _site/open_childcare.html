##  Topic 1: 
##       Finding childcare/social interaction for 3 year old. Since we have a 13 and 10 year old, as well as a 5 and 3 year old, families are not willing to form pods with us. We&#39;re new to the area, so the friends available and wanting to be friends with 13 and 10, are in families who are not being safe. In sum, we&#39;re short on friends-social interaction for us and kids.
##      Figuring out what to do about childcare when my unemployment runs out.

##      Working child care schedule
##      Finding work and child care
##      Not knowing when my husband will be hired back at his job. Not knowing what to do for childcare when my busy season starts for work.
##      Figuring out childcare and paying medical expenses. We were using my partner&#39;s mother for childcare but my brother in laws haven&#39;t been being cautious enough and using masks, handwashing, and social distancing as much as we would like and since they are exposed constantly to my mother in law we have decided to stop using her for childcare right now. We have to be extra cautious as we are expecting our twins to come any time now and we can&#39;t risk exposing them. For this same reason, we aren&#39;t ready for our daughter to go back to preschool. This pregnancy has included many complications so in addition to medical bills we already had for my partner&#39;s surgery a couple years ago and my daughters doctor&#39;s appointments over the last couple years, we now have a huge amount of medical bills for this pregnancy. This has caused us to have challenges with managing all the payments and establishing payment plans we can afford.</code></pre>

##       Being able to go to the store to buy essentials, like clothing, shoes, groceries. No childcare available at this time, &amp; dear of covid-19 spread within the family.
##      My daughter was always on the shy side and sometimes with separation anxiety, a lot of which I attributed to my being a stay at home mom and her always being with me. But since we’ve been completely quarantining for months due to fears of Covid I worry she’ll be socially regressed after this. She’s great with her dad and I but I don’t know how she’ll be with others. Also, it’s been hard to never get a break as a SAHM and hard on our marriage. We used to use a babysitter to go on dates and we miss that.
##      Not contracting COVID / not spreading to grandparents who have had to assist with childcare
##      Being secluded from older family members, how will the school year look next year, as both my husband and I are teachers and my eldest daughter is to start Kindergarten next year. Also, I have a very young son who will need to start going to a nanny, and I am a little anxious about that change.
##      I am unable to support my kids on my own and have to live with my parents because neither of my sons fathers provide any form of support for their kids. I do not receive child support from either of them. My older sons fathers doesn&#39;t even want to meet him. it is hard for me to work because I do not have childcare. I don&#39;t have a babysitter And basically I would be working just to put my kids in childcare and but there would be nothing left.</code></pre>

##      If I&#39;m un-furloughed it&#39;s a high covid risk position plus my daughter&#39;s risk at daycare.
##      There have been positive COVID cases in the daycare but the daycare isn&#39;t very concerned and isn&#39;t tracing. Daycare has limited hours and is no longer serving food but the cost has stayed the same.
##      I am concerned about finding quality childcare. Many daycare centers are still closed or have limited numbers of children they are taking due to the pandemic. We cannot find our infant a daycare spot and have had to rely on one off baby sitters and family  members to watch him.
##      Biggest concern is sending two small children to day care where the workers are not practicing physical distancing or wearing masks. Worries about the kids getting sick</code></pre>

##      One of the biggest challenges I am facing is working from home while still taking care of my child. I do utilize child care occasionally, but I often fear exposing my child to the virus. Especially since cases are so high in Louisiana. I feel a lot of guilt about the situation. I always feel like I’m torn between doing a million things and that I can’t fully dedicate myself to work or being a mother.
##      My oldest (8) is severely disabled (autism, nonverbal) and suffering from lack of physical, occupational and speech therapy. I am a stay at home mom working part time gigs from home but now without any childcare other than my hardworking husband. Both he and my daughter are high-risk for covid. 
## 
## I have severe anxiety (mostly managed through meds) but the pandemic is highly stressful for us all.

##       Our daughter just started preschool again 2 weeks ago after being at home for six months during Pandemic... Unfortunately she was just dismissed because she wasn&#39;t behaving properly. They gave her 4 days to adjust and now we have no childcare available. It is extremely frustrating when adults don&#39;t understand the children need time to adjust.
##      I was recalled from my job from being on furlough since March. I work in a child care facility and when we closed in March, I was paid by the director until June. I then was furloughed in July and was recalled to my position on 8/29. However, I was only working part time (3 days) when put on furlough and I was recalled to work 5 days. I was unable to do so since I only have child care 3 days a week from my mother. So I had to quit my job. I have been searching for a part time job (working 3 days) since quitting my job. I have been waiting for a decision to be made by unemployment since the beginning of the month to see if I still qualify for unemployment benefits. So essentially, I have had no income for 3 weeks and we have been relying on our savings which are draining. So finances are a challenge and me finding new work is stressful since I can only

My mother in law will need to watch him 3 days now instead of 2 and she lives far and her health is in question.  I struggle with deciding whether I should look for a permanent position (my lay off was based on a budget deficit) or take subbing and more likely expose myself to COVID but work fewer days to provide childcare for my son.

##       We had a very active social life pre-pandemic and have not socialized with anyone with March 11th. Our weeks were busy and fun, filled with preschool, play dates, playgrounds, gymnastics class, family visits, and now my daughter is missing her friends and teachers terribly. I am struggling with my own loneliness and fear. Although they weren’t very close, my husbands grandmother just passed away in a nursing home from Covid-19, and it has made us very apprehensive about visiting either of our parents. We wish we had answers about when the world might look more like it did before.
##      I&#39;m concerned about loneliness and feeling disconnected. My biggest concern is about my daughters. The three year old goes to prek3, but they&#39;re not allowed to sit next to each other or play together. She misses her friends a lot and is always desperate to play with other children when we go to the park. Every day she asks to play with a friend or to go to the playground to see if she can find any friends. It breaks my heart. Before she started prek3 in September,  we&#39;d  spent the full 6 mo that in isolation. She had started getting depressed. My sweet 3 year old was depressed. She said things like &quot;my tummy hurts&quot;, and she wasn&#39;t sick or hungry or injured. She would spend part of her nap time yelling out her bedroom window &quot;animals come! My name is xyz. Animals come!&quot; Because she wanted animal friends. One night she started singing &quot;we&#39;re  sad, we&#39;re sad, family is sad, because we&#39;re trapped, we&#39;re trapped, in the house &quot;. She would get sad when we talked to her grandparents on the tablet, pointing out that they were not here. The first 4 mos of the pandemic were so hard. Now for my 7 mo th old I worry about her socialization. And having friends -- how is she going to make friends?? She is at home with us, not daycare. When should we start setting up aydates for her? Should we? Can we?? What are the first 2 years of her life going to be with this isolation?????

##       mental health and childcare
##      We have a 3 month old baby and are both currently on parental leave but that will come to an end and we have to make decisions about putting our young baby in child care, what child care, and when which is difficult with so much uncertainty around COVID and fear of exposure. We are fortunate to have option to have family help provide care but are concerned about our child’s social and other development because he will not be interacting with anyone besides my husband and me and potentially one other family member. We may also have the option for one or both of us to reduce hours at work but that would mean reduction in family income.
##      Job security going forward. Our child’s experiences when daycare reopens.
##      My 4.5 year old was exposed to COVID at his school (he&#39;s in a summer program) by a teacher. The school handled it really well and we got his test results back today (negative, yay!). But my husband and I have been home with both kids all week waiting on the test results. Now, we&#39;ll keep staying home until the school reopens his classroom. The baby (6 months) will go back to the nanny we share with another family, so I&#39;ll be able to work from home and get more done without the baby here.

The college plans to open in-person and my department has said it’s “all hands on deck” due to smaller class sizes and needed to give students personalized attention. I’m going to need to be on campus a lot. I’m hoping my grandparents will watch my daughter two days per week, as they did pre-covid, but at the same time it feels super risky due to their age and health histories and me being around groups of people
## On campus.
##      I have found a daycare provider now but I’m worried that my son will be exposed to the virus there
##      So much worry and stress. No backup child care. Unable to attend if she has a minor symptom. Worried about heading into cold and flu season. Just worried about sustaining this level of stress.
##      Right now the biggest challenge is navigating virtual learning with 3 sons and a 3 year old. Our district has had to cancel school all week due to smoke. The moke makes them unable to open classrooms and pump in fresh air to mitigate the spread of covid. I am having a hard time getting my work done.
##      Isolation/boredom from pandemic combined with extreme temperatures (we are in Phoenix). We literally can’t leave our house and it’s awful!

##  Topic 7: 
##       Having one parent home to act as the guardian of our social emotional health, and also so we don’t have to expose our kids to other kids’ potential germs at daycare, is the most helpful thing right now. My husband is an essential worker and we do have income, thank goodness, but the government assistance for the pandemic is also incredibly helpful.
##      Our income has stayed the same so far so at least we aren&#39;t stressed about money right now (especially with paying less for child care since the kids are mostly home with us).
##      We are thankful to have found the kids a nanny for half of the week. That person has been quite uplifting, and she is great at making sure the kids get out and move their bodies in safe places.
##      That our daycare center has not closed. If they closed I would have to quit my job to stay home and we would not make enough money on one income to pay bills
##      Ability for me to work from home and taking care of my kids at the same time. This has allowed me to save up on commuting and childcare cost, therefore enabled me to pay down debt and better financially. Also, I feel more at ease and stress reduce as I don’t have obligation to head to office for work and leave my kids with a sitter.</code></pre>

##  Topic 8: 
##       We decided to create a COVID bubble with our next door neighbors, who also work from home and take the same precautions we do regarding social distancing. We spend time with them and let our kids, who are classmates, play together. Both kids are only children, so having another kid to play with after 3 months of isolation has been wonderful for them, and for the adults too.
##      Is “my mom” an appropriate answer? I really don’t know.  This is very isolating.  Since my daughter goes to daycare, she could be carrying the virus and I am scared to be around family members because I do not want to unknowingly pass the virus to people I love (or anyone).  I’d love for this to end.
##      Video chats with family members. Social distance visits in yard with sister/daughter. Online learning resources. Walmart pick-up and Amazon delivery. Partial unemployment I&#39;m receiving as I stopped working as a COVID-19 precaution to protect my family (also lacked childcare).
##      Daycare has been of great help for us with our youngest. That took off a greater burden while we&#39;re at home working. We&#39;ve been having social distancing playdates and seeing family over video calls or in front/back yards with social distancing parameters. We take weekly weekend bike rides as a family and go swimming every weekend, if not during the week. I&#39;ve been having bimonthly video calls with my closest girlfriends. I practice daily reiki and meditation. Our daughters love their yoga and my oldest loves her meditation class she takes twice a week. Giving our girls screen time (not being so strict) has been helpful for the most part (until we have to turn the TV off or remove the tablet). Getting more 1:1 time with my husband has been really nice. Me cooking from home more and having dinner together at a more reasonable hour to put the girls to bed at an earlier bedtime has been very helpful.
##      Having a steady income and socially distanced contact with our next door neighbors, whose son is also in my daughter&#39;s class at school. The kids have exchanged letters and toys, and we have cooked meals for each other and left them on the doorstep. It&#39;s been a nice way to stay connected.</code></pre>

##  Topic 9: 
##       The extra 600 has helped me add to the funds I saved for a used car. I could buy a 13,000 car cash if I wanted to but now more concerned with Bill&#39;s in the future I can&#39;t work due to no childcare and e learning. Have snap helps me stock up on foods as prices increase and meat is scarce or limited. Free lunch from schools they give for the week helps me feed my kids a portion controlled meal 3 times a day and helps me save money by not spending it on fast food, etc. No disconnect on light bill let&#39;s me pay on the lights when I am financially able to pay it instead of paying lump sum when I am late on payment. I keep balance under $225. Medicaid allows me to go to Doctors care when I am really concerned about me or my children&#39;s health but afraid to go to regular doctors office that&#39;s crowded especially pediatric offices. I can sign in online and wait in car until called.
##      My parents help with childcare and that helps immensely
##      food stamps, my parents with childcare
##      Free food programs through daughters school and produce distribution through local churches. Extended Family helping with childcare
##      My parents stayed with us for 3 weeks and helped with childcare and all sorts of cleaning and projects around the house.</code></pre>

##       Working from home! Since our childcare plans either got too dangerous or fell through because of covid, it&#39;s been great that my work can be done entirely from home and my husband has been able to be home a few afternoons a week so I can focus on work.
##      The fact that my husband has remained steadily employed and that I was already a stay at home mom so we aren’t scrambling for childcare. It’s nerve racking for my husband to leave each day and potentially be exposed but having a steady paycheck is a godsend.
##      My mom moved in with us to support our childcare needs and has helped maintain our household while my husband and I work full time. It has been a great set up for myself, husband, her and my toddler.

##  Topic 13: 
##       My spouse just found full-time employment, so we needed to find additional childcare. We were lucky to find someone who can come to my spouse&#39;s home and look after the kids there while my spouse works remotely. Our kids are taking quite well to the childcare provider, and that has been a morale booster for our family.
##      Ourselves - we&#39;re doing our best to manage the situation. But our childcare center is fortunately also adjusting their billing/tuition process because they are not in full operations.
##      Honestly, having my husband furloughed means that we don&#39;t have to worry about finding a daycare center or nanny for our kids.
##      Our nanny is so helpful, but we have her for 10 hours a week, which is what we can afford right now, but isn&#39;t sufficient. She&#39;s also not equipped to care for our older children, so we don&#39;t always have good solutions to keep everyone happy.
##      That we don&#39;t have to find an odd source of child care as I work from home, although now I haven&#39;t been able to work at all without their head start program.</code></pre>
